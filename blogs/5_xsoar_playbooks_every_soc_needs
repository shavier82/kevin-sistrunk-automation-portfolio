## Introduction

If you're running a Security Operations Center (SOC), you know the pain: too many alerts, too little time, and too many manual steps. XSOAR (eXtended Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) can help, but only if you build the right playbooks.

After automating security operations for multiple SOC teams, I've identified **5 essential playbooks** that every SOC needs. These playbooks address the most common, time-consuming tasks that security analysts face daily.

**Why these 5?** They cover 80% of your SOC's repetitive work and can reduce manual processing time by 60-80%. Let's dive in.

## 1. Automated Threat Investigation Playbook

### The Problem

When an alert fires, analysts spend 10-15 minutes manually:
- Checking SIEM logs
- Querying EDR for endpoint details
- Looking up threat intelligence
- Correlating data across systems
- Writing investigation notes

### The Solution

An automated investigation playbook that:
1. **Enriches the alert** with data from SIEM, EDR, and threat intel
2. **Correlates related events** across systems
3. **Scores the threat** based on severity indicators
4. **Generates a summary report** with all findings
5. **Routes to the right team** based on threat type

### Key Integrations

- **SIEM** (Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel) - Pull logs and events
- **EDR** (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black) - Get endpoint details
- **Threat Intel** (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault) - Check IOCs
- **Ticketing** (ServiceNow, Jira) - Create/update tickets

### Expected Impact

- **Time saved:** 10-15 minutes per alert → 2-3 minutes
- **Consistency:** Every investigation follows the same process
- **Coverage:** No steps are missed

### Example Workflow

```
Alert Received
    ↓
1. Enrich with SIEM data (IP, user, process)
    ↓
2. Query EDR for endpoint details
    ↓
3. Check threat intel feeds (IP reputation, file hash)
    ↓
4. Correlate with past incidents
    ↓
5. Score threat (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
    ↓
6. Generate investigation report
    ↓
7. Route to appropriate team
```

## 2. Phishing Email Response Playbook

### The Problem

Phishing emails are the #1 attack vector, and they require immediate response:
- Analyze email headers and attachments
- Check URLs and domains
- Determine if users clicked
- Contain the threat if needed
- Notify affected users

This process takes 20-30 minutes per email, and SOCs receive dozens daily.

### The Solution

An automated phishing response playbook that:
1. **Analyzes email content** (headers, attachments, URLs)
2. **Checks URLs/domains** against threat intel
3. **Identifies affected users** who clicked or opened
4. **Contains the threat** (quarantine email, block URLs)
5. **Notifies users** with remediation steps
6. **Updates ticketing system** with resolution

### Key Integrations

- **Email Security** (Proofpoint, Mimecast, Office 365) - Analyze emails
- **Threat Intel** (URLhaus, PhishTank, VirusTotal) - Check URLs/domains
- **Active Directory** - Identify affected users
- **Email Gateway** - Quarantine/block
- **Ticketing** - Track resolution

### Expected Impact

- **Time saved:** 20-30 minutes → 5 minutes
- **Response time:** Immediate vs. waiting for analyst
- **Consistency:** Same process for every phishing email

### Example Workflow

```
Phishing Email Reported
    ↓
1. Extract email headers, attachments, URLs
    ↓
2. Check URLs against threat intel (malicious?)
    ↓
3. Check attachments (malware scan)
    ↓
4. Identify users who clicked/opened
    ↓
5. Quarantine email, block URLs
    ↓
6. Notify affected users
    ↓
7. Update ticket with resolution
```

## 3. Vulnerability Management Playbook

### The Problem

Vulnerability scanners generate thousands of findings. Analysts must:
- Prioritize vulnerabilities (CVSS scores, exploitability)
- Identify affected assets
- Check if patches are available
- Assign remediation tasks
- Track remediation progress

This is a full-time job for multiple analysts.

### The Solution

An automated vulnerability management playbook that:
1. **Ingests vulnerability scan results** (Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7)
2. **Enriches with threat intel** (exploit availability, CVE details)
3. **Prioritizes vulnerabilities** (CVSS + exploitability + asset criticality)
4. **Identifies affected assets** and owners
5. **Checks patch availability** and creates remediation tickets
6. **Tracks remediation progress** and generates reports

### Key Integrations

- **Vulnerability Scanners** (Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7) - Ingest scan results
- **Threat Intel** (CVE databases, Exploit-DB) - Enrich with exploit data
- **Asset Management** (CMDB, ServiceNow) - Identify asset owners
- **Ticketing** - Create remediation tasks
- **Reporting** - Generate dashboards

### Expected Impact

- **Time saved:** Hours of manual prioritization → Automated
- **Accuracy:** Consistent prioritization based on risk
- **Coverage:** No vulnerabilities missed

### Example Workflow

```
Vulnerability Scan Results
    ↓
1. Ingest scan results (CVE, CVSS, affected assets)
    ↓
2. Enrich with threat intel (exploit available?)
    ↓
3. Prioritize (CVSS + exploitability + asset criticality)
    ↓
4. Identify asset owners
    ↓
5. Check patch availability
    ↓
6. Create remediation tickets
    ↓
7. Generate priority report
```

## 4. Incident Response Automation Playbook

### The Problem

When a security incident occurs, time is critical. Analysts must:
- Contain the threat immediately
- Collect forensic evidence
- Notify stakeholders
- Document everything
- Coordinate response across teams

This process is error-prone under pressure and takes 1-2 hours per incident.

### The Solution

An automated incident response playbook that:
1. **Detects and classifies** the incident type
2. **Contains the threat** automatically (isolate endpoints, block IPs)
3. **Collects forensic evidence** (memory dumps, logs, artifacts)
4. **Notifies stakeholders** (SOC manager, CISO, legal)
5. **Creates incident ticket** with all details
6. **Coordinates response** across teams
7. **Generates incident report** for post-mortem

### Key Integrations

- **SIEM** - Detect and classify incidents
- **EDR** - Contain threats, collect evidence
- **Network Security** (firewalls, proxies) - Block malicious traffic
- **Communication** (Slack, Teams, Email) - Notify stakeholders
- **Ticketing** - Track incident lifecycle
- **Forensics** - Collect and preserve evidence

### Expected Impact

- **Response time:** 1-2 hours → 10-15 minutes
- **Consistency:** Same process for every incident
- **Documentation:** Automatic, complete incident reports

### Example Workflow

```
Security Incident Detected
    ↓
1. Classify incident type (malware, data breach, etc.)
    ↓
2. Contain threat (isolate endpoints, block IPs)
    ↓
3. Collect forensic evidence (logs, memory dumps)
    ↓
4. Notify stakeholders (SOC manager, CISO)
    ↓
5. Create incident ticket
    ↓
6. Coordinate response (assign tasks)
    ↓
7. Generate incident report
```

## 5. Compliance Reporting Playbook

### The Problem

Compliance reporting is tedious and time-consuming:
- Collect data from multiple systems
- Format reports according to compliance requirements
- Track compliance metrics over time
- Generate reports for auditors

This takes days or weeks per reporting cycle.

### The Solution

An automated compliance reporting playbook that:
1. **Collects data** from all security systems
2. **Calculates compliance metrics** (patch compliance, log retention, etc.)
3. **Generates formatted reports** (PDF, Excel, CSV)
4. **Tracks trends** over time
5. **Distributes reports** to stakeholders
6. **Archives reports** for audit trail

### Key Integrations

- **All Security Systems** - Collect compliance data
- **Reporting Tools** - Generate formatted reports

### Example Workflow

```
Compliance Report Triggered (Monthly/Quarterly)
    ↓
1. Collect data from all systems
    ↓
2. Calculate compliance metrics
    ↓
3. Compare to compliance requirements
    ↓
4. Generate formatted report (PDF, Excel)
    ↓
5. Track trends (compare to previous period)
    ↓
6. Distribute to stakeholders
    ↓
7. Archive for audit trail
```

## Implementation Tips

### Start Small

Don't try to build all 5 playbooks at once. Start with **#1 (Threat Investigation)** because:
- It's the most common use case
- It provides immediate value
- It's relatively simple to build
- You can iterate and improve

### Use Parallel Processing

When building playbooks, use **parallel processing** for independent tasks:
- Query SIEM and EDR in parallel
- Check multiple threat intel feeds simultaneously
- Generate reports while collecting data

This can reduce playbook execution time by 60-80%.

### Validate Everything

Build validation into every playbook:
- Validate data before processing
- Check for errors at each step
- Ensure state consistency
- Log everything for audit

### Test Thoroughly

Test playbooks with:
- Real alerts (in a test environment)
- Edge cases (missing data, API failures)
- Performance (how long does it take?)
- Error handling (what happens when something fails?)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Process

Document your current manual processes:
- What steps do analysts take?
- How long does each step take?
- What tools do they use?
- Where are the bottlenecks?

### Step 2: Prioritize

Rank the 5 playbooks by:
- **Frequency** - How often is this process performed?
- **Time Impact** - How much time would automation save?
- **Complexity** - How difficult is it to automate?

### Step 3: Build the First Playbook

Start with the highest-priority playbook:
1. Map out the workflow
2. Identify integrations needed
3. Build the playbook in XSOAR
4. Test with real data
5. Deploy and iterate

### Step 4: Measure and Improve

Track metrics:
- Time saved per playbook execution
- Error rate
- Analyst satisfaction
- Process consistency

Use these metrics to improve playbooks over time.
